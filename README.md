- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

2. **Start development server:**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

3. **Build for production:**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run build
   \`\`\`

4. **Preview production build:**
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run preview
   \`\`\`

### PWA Installation
- Open the app in a modern browser
- Look for the "Install App" button (appears automatically)
- Click to install the app on your device
- The app will work offline after installation

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Choices

**React + Vite**: Chosen for fast development, excellent developer experience, and optimal build performance. Vite provides instant hot module replacement and efficient bundling.

**IndexedDB with localStorage fallback**: IndexedDB provides robust client-side storage with better performance for larger datasets. localStorage serves as a fallback for older browsers.

**Custom Hooks**: Used \`useTodos\` hook to encapsulate all todo-related state management and operations, promoting code reuse and separation of concerns.

**Component-based Architecture**: Each UI element is a separate component, making the code modular, testable, and maintainable.

### Storage Strategy

The app uses a dual-storage approach:
1. **Primary**: IndexedDB for modern browsers (better performance, more storage)
2. **Fallback**: localStorage for older browsers or when IndexedDB fails

Data persists across browser sessions and survives page reloads.

### PWA Implementation

**Service Worker**: Automatically generated by Vite PWA plugin, implements cache-first strategy for static assets.

**Manifest**: Configured for standalone display mode with proper icons and theme colors.

**Offline Support**: All functionality works offline through local storage and cached assets.

## Usage Guide

### Adding Tasks
1. Enter task title in the form
2. Select priority level (Low/Medium/High)
3. Optionally set a deadline
4. Add notes/description if needed
5. Click "Add Task"

### Managing Tasks
- **Complete**: Check the checkbox next to any task
- **Edit**: Click "Edit" button (disabled for completed tasks)
- **Delete**: Click "Delete" button - shows undo option for 5 seconds
- **Search**: Use the search bar to find tasks by title or notes

### Viewing Tasks
- **List View**: Traditional list with sorting options
- **Smart Sections**: Organized by Overdue, Today, Upcoming, No Deadline
- **Filtering**: Use "All", "Active", or "Completed" buttons
- **Sort**: Choose sort criteria and order (ascending/descending)

### Offline Usage
- The app works completely offline after first load
- All changes are saved locally
- Install prompt appears for easy access

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge 88+
- Firefox 78+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers with PWA support

## Performance Features

- Lazy loading of components
- Efficient re-rendering with React hooks
- Optimized bundle size with Vite
- Service worker caching for instant loading
- IndexedDB for fast data operations

## Security Considerations

- No external API calls (fully client-side)
- Local data storage only
- No sensitive data transmission
- CSP-friendly implementation

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- Task categories/tags
- Recurring tasks
- Data export/import
- Collaboration features
